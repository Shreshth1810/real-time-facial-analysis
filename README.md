# Real-Time Facial Emotion and Gender Classification

This project implements a real-time facial analysis system that detects and classifies **emotions** and **gender** from live webcam input. It combines **YOLOv3** for face detection with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, optimized for high accuracy and low-latency performance on standard hardware.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time face detection using YOLOv3
- Emotion and gender classification using CNNs
- Live webcam inference with instant visual feedback
- Accuracy: ~97.5% (emotion), ~96.6% (gender)
- Lightweight and runs smoothly on consumer devices
- Uses data augmentation and transfer learning for improved generalization

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- YOLOv3
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `final_results_gender_test.ipynb`: Main notebook with model implementation, inference pipeline, and results.

## ðŸ“Š Results

| Task         | Accuracy |
|--------------|----------|
| Emotion      | 97.5%    |
| Gender       | 96.6%    |
